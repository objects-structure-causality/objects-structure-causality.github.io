        <b><a href="https://qianrusun.com/">Qianru Sun</a></b> is an assistant professor of computer science in the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University (SMU), with research interests covering object recognition and causality. She co-organized the 1st workshop of Causality in Vision at CVPR '21, and will introduce her works bridging causality and computer vision applications.

        <b><a href="https://www.ml.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/people/kstelzner/">Karl Stelzner</a></b> is a PhD Student at the Technical University Darmstadt. He draws inspiration from cognitive science and robotics to study how machines can obtain useful representations from noisy, unstructured input data without requiring expensive manual labeling. In particular,  he combines techniques from graphical models, probabilistic programming, and deep learning.

        <b><a href="https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/nikolaus-kriegeskorte-phd">Nikolaus Kriegeskorte</a></b> is a Professor at Columbia University, affiliated with the Departments of Psychology and Neuroscience. He studies how our brains enable us to see and understand the world around us. He is a Principal Investigator and Director of Cognitive Imaging at the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Kriegeskorte is a co-founder of the conference “Cognitive Computational Neuroscience”. His recent research particularly focuses on object-centric representations both in brains and machines.

        <b><a href="https://www.thomaspouncy.com/">Thomas Pouncy</a></b> is a PhD Candidate at Harvard with Sam Gershman. He studies theory-based reinforcement learning, where an agent explores and models an environment by building abstract, causal models of the constituent physical objects, intentional agents, and their interactions.

        <b><a href="https://nke001.github.io/">Rosemary Ke</a></b> is a research scientist at DeepMind and PhD candidate at MILA with Yoshua Bengio and Chris Pal and was named a rising star in ML in 2020. She was one of the early researchers applying neural networks for causal discovery and she will bring her perspective on fundamental challenges learning abstractions and discovering causal relations with deep learning.

        <b><a href="http://alisongopnik.com/">Alison Gopnik</a></b> is a professor of psychology and affiliate professor of philosophy at the University of California at Berkeley, where she has taught since 1988. She is a world leader in cognitive science, particularly the study of children’s learning and development. Recently, she and her team have been particularly interested in how children figure out psychological causality and how that helps them build a “theory of mind”.
